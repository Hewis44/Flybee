# Flybee – Autonomous Fixed-Wing UAV

Flybee is a lightweight, fully autonomous fixed-wing UAV designed and modeled from scratch. The goal of the project was to create a modular aircraft that is both simple to build and capable of performing autonomous missions using Pixhawk. The entire frame was designed in Fusion 360, carefully modeled to balance aerodynamic efficiency with structural integrity. The airframe uses a high-wing layout and rectangular planform for better stability and ease of manufacturing. I selected the GOE225 airfoil after comparing it with others such as S1223 and NACA4412, and finalized it based on CFD simulations and performance plots. The V-tail configuration was chosen to reduce surface area and weight while still providing full control authority, and it was custom-modeled to fit neatly into the fuselage design.

This repository includes the final laser cutting files for the entire aircraft, including the wing ribs, fuselage sections, and tail surfaces. All files were exported directly from Fusion 360 after validating fit and alignment, and can be used directly with a laser cutter. The structure is meant to be built from lightweight balsa and aeroply materials, assembled using adhesives like Araldite and covered in Monokote or similar film for improved finish and durability.

The autonomous system is based on a Pixhawk 2.4.8 flight controller with GPS and telemetry modules, allowing waypoint-based missions and return-to-launch capability using Mission Planner. While I’ve completed all structural and aerodynamic work, the flight testing and autopilot tuning are still ongoing. The design was developed as a compact and functional UAV that can be easily carried, repaired, and customized for different mission profiles.

Only the laser cutting files are shared in this repo, but they represent the full design ready for fabrication. If you're interested in building a simple but powerful autonomous fixed-wing drone, feel free to use these files or modify them as needed.
