# Flybee – Autonomous Fixed-Wing UAV
Flybee is a fully homegrown, lightweight, and modular autonomous fixed-wing UAV that I developed from scratch as part of my passion for aeromodelling and autonomous systems. Since childhood, I was fascinated by how aircraft fly and always dreamt of building my own drone. With Flybee, that dream started taking real shape. The idea was not just to make a drone that flies, but to design everything myself—from the aerodynamic layout to the structure and control system—so I could understand how each part contributes to the whole flight system. The design process was completely done in Onshape, where I iterated on the airframe layout several times, focusing on balancing aerodynamic performance, ease of manufacturing, and structural strength. I used a high-wing configuration with a rectangular wing planform to ensure passive stability, which is very helpful for autonomous flight and easier for tuning during initial flights.

I carefully compared multiple airfoils such as the S1223 and NACA4412 using CFD simulations and lift-drag plots, and finally selected the GOE225 airfoil for its balanced characteristics across different speeds and angles of attack. For the tail, I wanted to reduce the number of moving surfaces and mechanical parts, so I designed a V-tail, which was then blended into the fuselage to reduce drag and weight while keeping it aesthetically clean and functional. Every part of the frame—wing ribs, fuselage sections, and tail pieces—was later transferred to Fusion 360 to validate alignment and fit. After finalising the dimensions and checking tolerances, I exported them as DXF files suitable for laser cutting. These are included in this repository and can be used as-is on balsa or aeroply sheets.

The structure is lightweight and strong enough for mid-range autonomous missions. I chose materials like balsa wood and aeroply because they’re easy to work with, locally available, and provide a good weight-to-strength ratio. Assembly was done using adhesives like Araldite and Fevicol Marine, and I used Monokote film to cover the airframe, giving it a polished look while also adding some resistance to moisture and wear. All these steps were carried out manually in a small home workshop setup, making this a purely DIY project from start to finish.

On the electronics side, the UAV is powered by a Pixhawk 2.4.8 flight controller, along with a Ublox Neo-M8N GPS module, telemetry radios, and basic power distribution. The autopilot was configured using Mission Planner, which allows full waypoint missions, geofencing, and RTL (Return To Launch) features. I also used the FlySky FS-i6 transmitter and iA6B receiver for manual override and initial ground testing. The motor is a powerful T-Motor AS2820 1050KV paired with a 60A ESC and a 13-inch propeller, all running on a 3S 3300mAh LiPo battery. During development, I put a lot of effort into wire management and power distribution to keep the internals neat and reliable. The aircraft’s internal bay was designed to be modular so that future upgrades like camera gimbals or advanced sensors can be easily added.

While most of the structural and design work is complete, the UAV is currently undergoing flight testing. I am fine-tuning the PID parameters and testing different mission profiles in open fields nearby. The first flights are being done manually to trim the control surfaces and validate center of gravity, followed by semi-autonomous and full-autonomous tests. I plan to log flight data and refine the performance based on real-world feedback, which will later help in optimizing the structure and maybe even designing a second version.


This repository contains only the laser cutting files for now, but they represent the complete airframe, ready to be fabricated and assembled. In the future, I will also try to upload build photos, wiring diagrams, and maybe a full setup guide for others who wish to build their own version of Flybee. The project was developed for the Highways Hackclub under the builder alias Hewis_lamilton, and I hope it can serve as a starting point for other students, hobbyists, or aero clubs looking to dive into fixed-wing autonomous flight. If you’re curious or inspired to build, feel free to fork, modify, or even reach out. This project is meant to be shared, improved, and flown.
